# Belly Button Diversity Challenge

  This project is an interactive dashboard that visualizes the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs microbial species found in belly buttons. Using D3.js and Plotly.js, the dashboard dynamically updates to display a selected test subjectâ€™s demographic information, a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 microbial species, and a bubble chart showing the full microbial composition. The data is retrieved from an external JSON file, and the dropdown menu allows users to explore different samples. The dashboard is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All code was written by myself and troubleshooted and edited with ChatGPT.
